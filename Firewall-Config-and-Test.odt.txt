                                                  Firewall Configuration and Testing

1. Opening of firewall by the command sudo ufw for help messege.
2. Then checking of current rules by the command sudo ufw status numbered.
3. After checking the rules then adding a rule to block a specific port (e.g., 23 telnet) by the command sudo ufw deny 23/tcp.
4. Testing the rule which is denied by connecting to that port locally telnet localhost 23. If the connection is refused then the command is correct.
5. Adding an another rule to allow the ssh protocol sudo ufw allow 22/tcp.
6. Removing the test blocked rule by the command sudo ufw delete deny 23/tcp.
7. The firewall filters works to allow, block, or log traffic by the configured policy. They can collect the packet information by ip addresses, ports, and protocols.
